<h1>The 3 Best Movie Franchises According to Eduardo</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movie Franchises</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The James Bond Movie Franchise</h3>
<p>I grew up watching Pierce Brosnan play a smooth, suave and cool James Bond. Since then I have watched all 25 films of the British spy.</p>
<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>I love the idea of using the force and having a battle between good and evil with swords that light up in different colors</p>
<h3>The Harry Potter films</h3>
<p>Great movies that follow the characters battling against evil in the magical world from kids to young adults.</p>
