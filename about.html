<p>During the pandemic Eduardo took a course on Skillshare to learn about HTML and CSS. He enjoyed it a lot
    after the course he created a website for upcoming movies as small project which showed a timer countdown
    for each movie. Unfortunately work in the enterainment industry began to pick up again for him and he 
    wasn't to stay focused on studying as he was concentrated on moving up the ladder within the entertainment industry.
